Title: Mastering Bill Detection with R or Python 📊💸

Introduction:

Welcome to the fascinating realm of detecting counterfeit bills using data analytics! 💼🔍 In this project, you'll dive into the world of data as a consultant Data Analyst for the National Organization for Combating Counterfeiting (ONCFM). 🛡️💰 Your mission? To develop a robust model capable of automatically identifying authentic and counterfeit euro bills based on specific dimensions and elements.

Project Overview:

Your consultancy journey unfolds in collaboration with the ONCFM under the guidance of Marie, the project lead. 🤝 Your task involves implementing a modeling approach to distinguish genuine bills from counterfeit ones, leveraging key features extracted from the bill dataset provided.

As you embark on this data-driven mission, remember the valuable tip from your colleague regarding handling missing values using linear regression. 📉🔍 Your toolkit will consist of R or Python, as you navigate through data preprocessing, feature engineering, algorithm selection, and model evaluation.

Deliverables and Presentation:

Your deliverables will encapsulate your analytical journey:

Comprehensive R or Python code containing all treatments, tests, and the final application for detecting counterfeit bills. 🖥️🔍

A detailed presentation of your methodology, including data preprocessing steps, feature selection strategies, algorithm exploration, and the final model chosen. 📊📈

The oral presentation will include:

A thorough walkthrough of your analytical approach, treatments, and model selection process. 🗣️📊
Live testing of the algorithm using a provided dataset during the presentation. 🧪🔍
A discussion session for exchanging questions and answers, followed by feedback from the evaluator. 🤔💬
Skills Evaluated:

This project assesses your proficiency in:

Performing logistic regression and linear regression for predictive analysis. 📊🔍
Implementing automatic classifications to partition data effectively. 📈🛡️
Executing predictive analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data. 📉💡
Get ready to showcase your data prowess and unravel the mystery of counterfeit bill detection! 💼🔍 Let's embark on this data-driven journey and make a meaningful impact in combating counterfeiting. 💪💸
